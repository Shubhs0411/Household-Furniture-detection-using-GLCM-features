Feature Extraction is a method of capturing visual content of images for indexing and retrieval. Primitive or low-level image features can be either general features, such as extraction of color, texture and shape or domain specific features. Feature extraction involves simplifying the number of resources required to describe a large set of data accurately. Through such methods we could identify different objects located inside an image and help understand any computer to detect those. One such feature extraction method is the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), taking around 900 images of three household furniture classes (Bed, Chair and Sofa) for training and applying GLCM feature extraction method will help us to detect these objects through Computer Vision. After training and testing and testing these images on a classifier model we will be able to detect if there exists any furniture (Bed, Chair and Sofa) in an image given by the user in real time.
